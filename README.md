# Tech Talk Demo Repository

Welcome! This repository is designed to demonstrate how to use Git for collaborative development. 
Throughout this process, all team members should research and explore the activities listed below. 
These tasks will be similar (if not simplified) to how you will collaborate on your projects in GitHub.

## Getting Started

0. **Select a Collaborator**: Choose one member from each group to be added as a collaborator. That student should email nicholas.lipari@louisiana.edu with their GitHub username.
1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Make Changes**: Modify the `index.html` or `styles.css` files as needed. Ensure you make changes in the appropriate sections.
3. **Update Your Information**: Add your name and a brief description of your changes to the list in `index.html`.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Stage and commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
5. **Push Your Changes**: Push your commits back to the repository.

## Changes to Be Made
1. **Add Group Members**: Include all student names from your group as an unordered list (`<ul> ... </ul>`) in the appropriate cell of the team grid.

## Have Fun!
