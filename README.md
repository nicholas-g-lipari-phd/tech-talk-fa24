# Tech Talk Demo Repository

Welcome! This repository is designed to demonstrate how to use Git for collaborative development. A live version of this demo can be found at https://nicholas-g-lipari-phd.github.io/tech-talk-fa24/ (expect 30-60 second delay for changes) 

Throughout this process, all team members should research and explore the activities listed below. 
These tasks will be similar (if not simplified) to how you will collaborate on your projects in GitHub.

## Getting Started

0. **Select a Collaborator**: Choose one member from each group to be added as a collaborator. That student should email nicholas.lipari@louisiana.edu with their GitHub username.
1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Make Changes**: Modify the `index.html` or `styles.css` files as needed. Ensure you make changes in the appropriate sections.
3. **Update Your Information**: Add your name and a brief description of your changes to the list in `index.html`.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Stage and commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
5. **Push Your Changes**: Push your commits back to the repository.

## Changes to Be Made
> **Important:** After making each change, *commit your updates to the repository* so we can view the results on the projector.
1. **Add Group Members**: Include all student names from your group as an unordered list (`<ul> ... </ul>`) in the appropriate cell of the team grid.
1. **Add a Team Description**: Below the list of group members in `index.html`, provide a brief description of your team's goals or project focus. Include any datasets or companies your project will focus on.
1. **Customize the Grid**: Modify the background color or style of your team's grid cell in the `styles.css` file to visually differentiate your group. 
Examples: background color, border, font style, background image
1. **Include Links**: Add any relevant links to resources, such as documentation or team project pages, within the `index.html` file.
1. **Create another Page for your Group**: Create a new HTML page for your team and link it from the main `index.html`, Populate the page with meaningful content to provide a detailed representation of your team's work so far.
1. **Troubleshooting Section**: Add a section for common issues and their solutions.
1. **Links to Learning Resources**: Include links to tutorials or documentation that may help students learn Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS.

## Have Fun!
